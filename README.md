 Tutorial:
	First input the amount of ingots you want to use as fuel in your reactor.
	Then input the amount of rf that is going to get extracted and inserted into the reactor every tick.
	After that you can just wait and look if the reactor would shutdown, etc.
	If you want to change the amount of rf, just press the left button and input your new values.
	With the pause button you can pause the simulation to look at all values.
